# Learning Deep Reinforcement Learning
*Notebooks and code from when I learned about Deep Reinforcement Learning.*

Almost all the material is me rewriting or adapting code from the excellent turtorials of Arthur Juliani, see his [original blog](https://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-0-q-learning-with-tables-and-neural-networks-d195264329d0) for a much better discussion.
